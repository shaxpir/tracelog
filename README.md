# Tracelog

Node.js APM instrumentation that writes traces to local JSONL files, with automatic rotation and optional S3 upload.

Forked from [elastic-apm-node](https://github.com/elastic/apm-agent-nodejs) v4.15.0. All 43 auto-instrumentation modules are preserved (Express, Fastify, Koa, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, AWS SDK, etc.), but instead of shipping data to an Elastic APM server, everything is written to timestamped `.jsonl` files on disk with time-based and size-based rotation.

## Installation

```
npm install tracelog
```

## Usage

Start tracelog at the very top of your application, before importing anything else:

```js
require('tracelog').start({
  serviceName: 'my-api',
  serviceVersion: '1.0.0',
  logFilePath: '/var/log/myapp/traces.jsonl',
});
```

Or use the auto-start entry point with environment variables:

```bash
TRACELOG_SERVICE_NAME=my-api \
node -r tracelog/start app.js
```

That's it. Tracelog will automatically instrument your HTTP servers, database clients, and other modules, writing transaction, span, error, and metric data to the JSONL file.

## Output format

Each line is a self-contained JSON object with one top-level key identifying the event type. There are five event types: `metadata`, `transaction`, `span`, `error`, and `metricset`. Files start with a metadata line:

```jsonl
{"metadata":{"service":{"name":"my-api","version":"1.0.0"},"process":{"pid":1234},"system":{"hostname":"ip-10-0-1-42"},"cloud":{"provider":"aws","instance":{"id":"i-0abc123"},"availability_zone":"us-east-1a"}}}
{"transaction":{"id":"abc123","trace_id":"def456","name":"GET /users","type":"request","duration":42.5,"result":"HTTP 2xx","sampled":true,"outcome":"success","span_count":{"started":1}}}
{"span":{"id":"ghi789","transaction_id":"abc123","trace_id":"def456","parent_id":"abc123","name":"SELECT * FROM users","type":"db","subtype":"postgresql","duration":12.3,"sync":true,"outcome":"success"}}
{"error":{"id":"err001","timestamp":1709740800000000,"exception":{"message":"Something broke","type":"TypeError","handled":false,"stacktrace":[...]}}}
{"metricset":{"timestamp":1709740800000000,"samples":{"system.process.cpu.total.norm.pct":{"value":0.023},"nodejs.memory.heap.used.bytes":{"value":52428800}}}}
```

For the complete schema of every field in each event type, see **[SCHEMA.md](SCHEMA.md)**.

## Configuration

All options can be set via `require('tracelog').start({...})`, via environment variables, or in a `tracelog.config.js` file.

| Option | Env Var | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|---------|-------------|
| `serviceName` | `TRACELOG_SERVICE_NAME` | from package.json | Name of your service |
| `serviceVersion` | `TRACELOG_SERVICE_VERSION` | from package.json | Version of your service |
| `environment` | `TRACELOG_ENVIRONMENT` | `NODE_ENV` or `development` | Deployment environment |
| `logFilePath` | — | `./tracelog.jsonl` | Base path for JSONL output files |
| `logMaxFileSize` | — | `104857600` (100MB) | Rotate when file exceeds this size in bytes |
| `logRotationSchedule` | `TRACELOG_LOG_ROTATION_SCHEDULE` | `daily` | Time-based rotation: `daily` or `hourly` |
| `s3Bucket` | `TRACELOG_S3_BUCKET` | — | S3 bucket for log upload (disabled if not set) |
| `active` | `TRACELOG_ACTIVE` | `true` | Enable/disable the agent entirely |
| `logLevel` | `TRACELOG_LOG_LEVEL` | `info` | Agent log level |

For the complete list of all configuration options (instrumentation, sampling, error capture, stack traces, span compression, metrics, S3 upload, cloud, and more), see **[CONFIG.md](CONFIG.md)**.
